üíª Interesting Code Snippet

I personally found the category-to-product listing endpoint clean and concise:

```java
@GetMapping("{categoryId}/products")
@PreAuthorize("permitAll()")
public List<Product> getProductsByCategory(@PathVariable int categoryId) {
    return productDao.listByCategoryId(categoryId);
}
